        Summary: This is an MIT research project to compare how different text
        visualizations help researchers understand conversations in online media.
        We will not track who you are, and any results publications will refer to
        results in aggregate.

      You have been asked to participate in a research study conducted by Ethan
      Zuckerman, Rahul Bhargava (M.S.), and  Rebekah Bell from the MIT Media Lab
      at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.). The purpose of this
      study is to compare the performance of different text visualizations used
      in the Media Cloud suite of web-based tools for analyzing online media.
      You were selected as a possible participant in this study because of your
      pre-existing interest in Media Cloud, visualization, or web-based research
      tools. You should read the information below, and ask questions about
      anything you do not understand, before deciding whether or not to
      participate.
    </p>
    <ul>

        the survey will take 15 to 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li> We do not foresee any potential risks of this research study. </li>
      <li>
        You could walk away from this study with a more critical mindset when
        using text visualizations.
      </li>
      <li> You will not be compensated for taking this survey. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> This project will be completed by June 1, 2018. </p>

      can be identified with you will remain confidential and will be disclosed
      only with your permission or as required by law. In addition, your
